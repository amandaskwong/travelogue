                <h2>Venice, Italy</h2>
                <p>
                    Italy has always been on my list of dream travel destinations!
                    Growing up, I always thought that Venice would sink before I would have the chance to visit.
                    Thankfully, my choir did a tour of Europe in 2019 and Venice was the first destination.

                    When visiting Italy, it is crucial to take time to enjoy the food!
                    At the top of my recommendations list is gelato. 
                    The light, cold, smooth dessert is the perfect treat for a summer day.
                    My favourite flavour of gelato is mango but other excellent options include strawberry, stracciatella, and coconut.

            <h2>Omis, Croatia</h2>
            <p>
                Following Italy, my choir headed to Croatia to participate in the inaugural Croatia International Jazz Festival.
                When I first signed up to go to Europe, I didn't expect to love Croatia as much as I did.
                We stayed in Omis at Kamp Galeb and each day we would visit a different town. 
                The best part of Omis is the access to the Adriatic Sea.
                The water is calm, warm, and blue, making it a great place to relax and have fun.
                If you have ever considered going to Croatia, go!
                It's not a very big tourist location so it's nice and quiet with lots to do and explore!

            <img src="./images/Barcelona.jpg" alt="An image of the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, Spain. The image is taken looking up from in front of the church." id="barcelonaIMG">
            <h2>Barcelona, Spain</h2>
            <p>
                Barcelona was one of the last stops on our tour of Europe!
                If you visit Barcelona, you have to visit Sagrada Familia. 
                This famous church has been under construction for over 140 years. 
                As a designer and an artist, this work of art blew my mind.
                The stained glass windows, the towering columns, and the intricate carvings make this the most impressive architectural project I've ever seen.
                Normally I'm not a big fan of visiting churches but you can't skip this one!
